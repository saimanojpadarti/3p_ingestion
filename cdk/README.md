# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

The contents of this project demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack with customizations for working with Cello and the paved roads

## Prerequisites

To get started testing/running the project you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) This will also automatically install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)


In addition, we recommend having a basic understanding of:

- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) The tool used by node/the js community for package management and running scripts
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) The language being used to write our code
- [CDK v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) The framework used to programmatically define our cloud resources
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) The framework used for writing unit and snapshot tests

## Getting Started

Run the following command from this directory to install the necessary dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Once this is done you can test that everything worked by running some tests

```sh
npm run test
```

From here you should be able to add any dependencies and code your resources as needed

**Note:** Make sure when adding cdk packages that the version being added exactly matches the version already being referenced by other cdk packages in your `package.json` file

## Resources
